- The [F1/10](http://f1tenth.org/) competition has everything you need to make a 1/10 scale, autonomous racer.
    What if we wanted to make one of these using *distributed* sensors, instead of an expensive LIDAR sensor?
    What if we wanted to make multiple vehicles communicate?
- The making and design processes behind the [deadmau5 cube v3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waGzVes6PWY) which uses embedded physical control to create a sound-interactive viewing experience.
- Taking instruments [beyond MIDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MuKTkukIw), and creating a suite of sound-control instruments based around highly physical interactivity.
- Taking the classical [inverted pendumlum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owe0o0ynUbY) problem to the realm of cheap mobility with `edumips`.
- Using the keyboard as an [universal IoT notification/control](https://www.daskeyboard.com/x/x50q-rgb-mechanical-keyboard/) system.
- Using the voice control APIs of existing human-interactive cloud systems to [control your computer](https://www.instructables.com/id/IoTyper-Control-Your-PC-Via-Alexa-IoT/)
- Rethink something as simple as the [lighting](https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-RGB-WiFi-Lamp/) of an environment. 
    Super-cool when combined with sensors to change the lights interactively.
- [Sound source localization](https://respeaker.io/6_mic_array/) ([2](https://respeaker.io/usb_4_mic_array/)) is an amazing capability to ascertain the direction of sound relative to an embedded system.
    How could you use this creatively?
- Really into [craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps), or role playing, but always felt like your dice [needed more bling](https://hackaday.io/project/28377-electronic-dice) -- or to interact with the users?
- Much of the future of embedded system is untethered and solar.
    To make that a reality, you need a [capable battery](https://hackaday.io/project/164733-pisugar-battery-for-raspberry-pi-zero).
- Our calendars rule our lives.
    Wouldn't it be nice if we could see both time and our schedule [at a glance?](https://www.instructables.com/id/CalClock-Simply-See-Your-Schedule/)
- Why have a [Furby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furby) if you can't [pwn a Furby](https://github.com/iafan/Hacksby)
- [Track and punish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_TSR_v07m0) package delivery robbers with cloud-connected embedded systems.
- [Application development environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE0bP-AS_sQ) for IoT devices.
- A [gameboy screen/stereo](https://youtu.be/FsqfhFsk2PQ?t=248)? Why not!
- [Remote control human orchestra?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dph-bkJL_wM) Sure, why not! Flip CPS around and use [human as actuator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu5jH2BgPBM).
- 3d interactive display. Oh yeah, made of [6000 lightbulbs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gW9zwK8Ydk&list=RDuu5jH2BgPBM&index=5).
- A number of [art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F4V_-shzlk), [interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev6r7AAg4V4), [creative uses of actuators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4QQzzU2diM), [augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VFsdPAoI1g&list=PL6uqON-thyrbkbUEGMRWMLLop9qeMashH), and other videos at [creators](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCreatorsProject/videos).
- Are there better ways to control traffic lights other than (illegal) [MiRTs](https://hackaday.io/project/162434-dont-call-the-cops) [(2)](http://www.themirt.com/how-it-works.php)? Related: how the doppler effect and other techniques are used in police [radar](https://youtu.be/vQtLms02PFM?t=647).
- What could you do with a [cheap infrared camera](https://youtu.be/u4DSzp77xwk?t=162)?
- Tangible [wave and beat shaping](https://youtu.be/Mgy1S8qymx0?list=TLPQMDIwMTIwMjDft11QejRomA).
- Simple [door alarm](https://youtu.be/xXs8Cxw4e2k?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw). Why not add face or bluetooth (for a specific smart phone) detection?
- Shooting a water cannon at [cats](https://youtu.be/uIbkLjjlMV8?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw)? Why not?
- Pezioelectric sensors are great for getting feedback from the environment.
    Use them to detect vibrations when [building an electric instrument](https://youtu.be/Zp2LCAv2CYY?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw&t=408), fit them into a glove to [play music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTJh_Kph1mU&list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw&index=16), or power a small [system](https://youtu.be/tYoGdxDPwL4?list=TLPQMDQwMTIwMjCFXJiZsHM4tw).
- Patients with head and neck cancer use wearable [tech](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20180517/Smart-technology-helps-improve-outcomes-for-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancer.aspx) (bluetooth enabled scale, bluetooth enabled blood pressure cuff and mobile app) to send information to their physician to see how they are responding to treatment. 
- A [smart mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVmDjJmcd2M) which has all the IoT features of controlling home devices (thermostats + lights in the video), while also pulling information about your day from local weather to your schedule. Your bedroom/bathroom will never be the same!
